I am an incoming Ph.D student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan advised by Vasileios Tzoumas.

My research interests lie in algorithmic robotics, including control theory, combinatorial optimization, and reinforcement learning with applications in robotic decision-making and motion planning.
